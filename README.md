Holzwege is a blog/diary. Since graduation I have struggled with writing.
While books expect me to present ideas in a linear fashion, I find myself wondering around
rather than following a pre-established path. Most often than not I prefer to turn in the sideway
and explore an unrelated topic.

I believe that writing is fundamentally different from talking.
Possibly, I have inherited Plato's hate for the written word.
Holzwege, from Heidegger's famous book, is my attempt to fall in love with writing again.
Holzwege will be all about fragmentation, mapping a forest and getting lost in a forest.
In Holzwege, each post can connect with multiple posts, so when you find yourself reading
a topic, you might want to switch to another, by following a different path.
